Hey there ðŸ‘‹,

I create blog posts and open source packages mainly about python and data engineering. You can see a list of what I am up to on [waylonwalker.com](waylonwalker.com).  If you found value in something I have created, please feel free to send a [tip](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/bBdtMQO) or give me a shout out [@_waylonwalker](https://twitter.com/_waylonwalker).

I also create a newsletter you can sign up at waylonwalker.com/newsletter  I would love to see you join.
